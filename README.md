allow users to write a number and the computer will try to read it

## An attempt at building a NN for MNIST dataset to recognise handwritten numbers. 
Using Tensorflow.js

## How to make it work
1. download/clone the project
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'parcel index.html --open'

## Try your own model
1. Go to index.js 
2. Edit the model
